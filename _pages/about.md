Hi! I am an MD-PhD student at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (expected graduation 2025). I am currently a memeber of Amit Bar-Or's lab, and my interests are in investigating the immune mechanisms of neuroinflammatory disorders in children, including multiple sclerosis.
